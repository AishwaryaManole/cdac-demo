testing git commands...
git checkout -b <branchname> : command to create new branch and switch to it
git reset --hard <commit_id> : command used to shift to particular commit

When you edit any file in remote branch then it is in the "remote workspace". Similar to "local workspace."
When you commit in the "remote workspace", then it goes to "remote/origin repository".
